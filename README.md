# Python + APIs

Python script that creates a representative visualization of weather from 600+ cities across the globe. Script is able to randomly select at least 500 unique cities based on latitude and longitude and perform a weather check on each city using a series of successive API calls. 

Findings: 
As expected, the weather becomes significantly warmer as one approaches the equator (0 Degrees Latitude). More interesting, however, is the fact that the southern hemisphere tends to be warmer this time of year (December) than the northern hemisphere, due to the Earth's axial tilt. There is no strong correlation between latitude and cloudiness. However, we can see that a strong band of cities sits at 0, 80, and 100% cloudiness. Additionally, there is no strong correlation between latitude and wind speed. However, in northern hemispheres, there is a flurry of cities with over 20 mph of wind.
